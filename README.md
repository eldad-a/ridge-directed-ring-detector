ridge directed ring detector
============================

Robust and highly performant ring detection algorithm for 3d particle tracking using 2d microscope imaging
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source for the ring detection algorithm introduced in [arXiv:1310.1371](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1371).

Some usage examples can be found in the accompanying ipython-notebook `code/demo.ipynb`; a static view is available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/eldad-a/ridge-directed-ring-detector/blob/master/code/demo.ipynb);

An easy way to get the required dependencies is using [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads), which is cross-platform, or any other Python distribution which includes [Cython](http://cython.org/), [Scipy](http://cython.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).
